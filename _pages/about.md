👨‍💻 I'm a Research Assistant at the AI Research Center, ACEM, Tribhuvan University.

🔬 My research focuses on applying AI to environmental monitoring, with interests in Computer Vision, Tabular Deep Learning, and more recently, Large Language Models (LLMs).

🧠 I’m currently working on LLMs and Tabular Deep Learning in collaboration with the Research and Innovation Unit (RIU) and BASF, Germany.
