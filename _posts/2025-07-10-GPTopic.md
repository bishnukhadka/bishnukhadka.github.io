## Notes


### Background to the paper

[Thielmann 2020](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344432349_Unsupervised_Document_Classification_integrating_Web_Scraping_One-Class_SVM_and_LDA_Topic_Modelling)
- Unsupervised document classification for imbalanced data sets poses a major challenge as it requires carefully curated dataset. 
- The authors propose an integration of web scraping, one-class Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Latent Dirich-let Allocation (LDA) topic modelling as a multi-step classification rule that circumvents manual labelling. 


[Weisser 2023](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00180-022-01246-z.pdf) 
- Topic modeling with method like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling (most commonly used model) is satisfactory for large text, but for small texts like (tweets) it is challenging. 
- The author compared the performance of LDA, Gibbs Sampler Dirichlet Multinomial Model (GSDMM) and the Gamma Poisson Mixture Model (GPM), which are specifically designed for sparse data. 
- They found that GSDMM and GPM are better for sparse data.
