# Path to Deeper Understanding, one Mini-Essay at a time

Will mini-essays make me a better research paper author? We will find out in a year. 

A deeper understanding of your area of interest is a dream for all humans and specially for someone aspiring to be a researcher. Deeper understanding allows you to ask deep questions and help find answers. Writing mini-essays forces you to pen to paper, what you know and most importantly what you do not. It reveals the knowledge gaps that you have. And you have to revisit the material for fulfilling the gaps in knowledge. And writing such that you are teaching to someone will make you understanding improve. The famous Feynman Technique. 

The three main problem faced by a author are the struggle in search of topic to write on, lack of inspiration, and lack of organization of knowledge.  Mini-Essays help you in all three aspects. 

Firstly, mini-essay are essay you write centered on a single idea without any fillers. This lifts the restriction that I placed on myself to study only the thing require for my work. Since, this only takes 10-20 minutes to write, you can write about anything that inspired, excited or moved you. Over a period of time, you will have an large array of these essay. The VOLUME. 

Secondly, the novelty of writing about something new will keep you hooked. You write about anything and everything, so there is never a lack of excitement and inspiration. 

Lastly, you build a bank of idea that are interconnected with other, so that you can pull out and use. 

I am sold on this, and will pursue this endeavor with all my heart. Meet you after a year.
