People want to be rich. They want to have a comfortable living. A bountiful life. They want cars, houses, land, boats, yachts, and much more. They want to be successful. They want to be praised for their excellent work. They want to be recognized, appreciated for their work. They want their work to be great. Better than others. Some people want to get out of the current bad situation that they are in. They want to get rid of the bad habits that is spiraling out of control. They want the sadness to end. 

However, can we expect abnormal results by being normal? Can we expect change by doing the same thing everyday? Definitely not. To be successful, to achieve abnormal result, you have to be abnormal. You have to be obsessive about the thing you want to be successful in. You have to grind everyday. And by everyday, I mean every-single-day. People are the result of their habits. And to remove the bad habits that is stopping you to be the best version of yourself, you need to change. You need to change your environment, you need to change your mindset, and you need to keep track of your thought process. Only then can we be successful or get out of the sticky situation that we are in. 

Therefore, we have to be abnormal ourself to achieve abnormal results. And we have to change for our life to change.
