If you think positive, positive things happen to you and if you think negative, negative things happen to you.  This is the law of attraction. But is it always possible to stay positive? Is it possible to think positively when everything around you is going wrong? When you try your best, give you one hundred percent, exhausted every inch of your willpower, and you fail, is it still possible to stay positive? May be we can, but it is definitely going to be hard. But what if we still manifest good things in hard times? How great would that be, right? Even I am skeptical about things. So, let's find out together. 

We know that every thing in this world is vibrations. Water is in a liquid state because of it's vibration. Oxygen is in a gaseous state due to it's vibration. All matter are in the state they are in is because of their vibration. If all matter is vibration, then we can say that our bodies is vibrations, our brains are vibrations. Now, is it far fetched to say that our thoughts, emotions are also vibrations? May be not right? It can be argued that even our words and our actions are vibrations as well. So, if reality is vibrations and so is our bodies, thoughts, emotions, words and actions, then if our thoughts and emotions are in resonance with our bodies and words? This means that if we project good vibrations to the world we shall receive good vibrations back in the form of good reality, and if we project bad vibrations we receive bad things. If pseudoscience is true and does work, then it can fully change our life for the better or for worse. Then why not try to test it and make it good? Let's find out if this is pseudoscience or reality. So let's project good vibes onto the world and hopefully, we get good things in return.
