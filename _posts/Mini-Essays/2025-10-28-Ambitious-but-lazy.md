Ask yourself if the following three statement are true for you or not? 
- I fantasize more than I act. 
- I consume ten times more than I produce. 
- I constantly delay Day#1. 
If any two of the three are true for you, then you are indeed `Lazy but Ambitious`. 

Now, we know that you are Lazy but Ambitious. In the state you are in you will first waste a day, then weeks, then months, and suddenly a decade has gone and you do not have the life that you desired. Always remember `Memento Mori` i.e., you will die. If you are going to die eventually, then why are you wasting life? Why are you consuming more that creating? Why are you miserable? 

But what steps can we take to mitigate this? 
1. **Kill you To-Do List** to **One Task a Day**
	- Your to-do list is doing more harm than good. You want to do so much in a single day, but your pre-frontal cortex (frontal part of the Brain) cannot handle everything at once. This means that it cannot multi-task. So, you wanting to do multiple thing in a single day is leading you to do nothing at all. 
	- Therefore, **One Task a Day**. Pick the most important task that you need to do, something that you need for your livelihood. And only focus on that task. It can be 'Read 10 pages', 'Go for a 10 minutes walk'. But make sure you do it. There should be `No Zero Days.`
2. **Gamify your Life**
	- Assign XP (Experience Points) to positive tasks, and reduce XP when involved in bad habits. 
	- Build Skill Tree. Keep building it. 
3. **Increase you Stake**
	- You need an accountability partner. You need to make the process of not doing the things that you said you will do, excruciating. It might be loosing money or not living up to your accountability partner's expectation. You can always make excuses to yourself, but explaining that to a different person is difficult.
