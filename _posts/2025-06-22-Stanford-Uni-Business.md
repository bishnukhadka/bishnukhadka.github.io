## 1. Stanford MBA Module #1 : Business Strategy

- The foundation of a successful company and the most important thing for a business is it's business strategy. Business strategy is the game plan you employ to create a successful business. 
- To learn how to create a great business plan is to study the business plan of the multi-billion dollar companies. 
- And the most efficient way to study other business plan, is to use the "Porter's Five Forces"


### 1.1. Porter's Five Forces
- The five forces are: 
    1. `Competition`: How competitive is your market?
    2. `Substitute` : How many substitute are there in the market? 
    3. `New Entry`: How susceptible is your product to a new entry. 
    4. `Buyer's Power`: How much the buyer have power over you? 
    5. `Supply Chain` : How much of the supply chain you control? 
- To understand this, John Ha, the maker of the video takes the example of Apple. 
- Apple has huge competition, in the phone market, the laptop market, the PC market and other thing in the name of Samsung, Microsoft, etc. Additionally, there are many substitute to apple products. Here, from the first two we can clearly analyze that Apple should have a hard time. However, they do not. In fact, they thrive in this environment. But why? 
- The answer is their `Ecosystem-lock`. Once you are in the apple eco-system, it is very hard to get out of it. Therefore, even if a new product is launched, the tendency of the apple user to choose a different company is pretty low. This means that Apple is not at all susceptible to new products. It does not matter if your first apple device is an iPhone, a Macbook, or an iPad, it is most likely the first apple product of many that you are going to own. And that is because of the ecosystem that Apple has built. 
- In addition to this, due to this ecosystem people tend to buy Apple. For example if there is a group in iMessage and an android user is in the group, it would cost money to send the person a text instead of using Wi-fi. Therefore, people have a social pressure to buy Apple. Then, once you have bought one Apple product, due to their superior inter-device functionality, it will most likely not be your last Apple device. So buyer's power over Apple is less. 
- Apple also has a really good supply chain, of which it has a very good control on. They tend to make most of the things they use, therefore the price can be controlled. Also, if another company tries to compete with you, due to your superior supply chain, it would be really hard for another company to compete. 
- These are the reason why Apple is the first trillion dollar public company (first company was PetroChina).
